# Sport80

A track and field application built using Dart, Flutter, and Firebase. Designed to help athletes track runs, manage events, and monitor performance. Initially a project for a company, it remains unfinished but showcases event management, run tracking, and seamless Firebase integration. A solid foundation for a future sports tracking tool.
